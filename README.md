# PyBer Analysis
Module 5 - PyBer with Matplotlib

# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze rideshare data for the company Pyber, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion.    Throughout this analysis, the data will be broken into three city types:  Urban, Suburban, and Rural.    For these segments, data will be presented to show total rides, total drivers, total fares, average ride fare, and average fare per driver.   This information will help identify differences in Pyber's markets to enable the company to make better informed strategic decisions.

# Results: 
To begin the analysis, a summary DataFrame was created.    This summary DataFrame groups information by the three city types:  Rural, Suburban, and Urban.     When analyzing this summary data, the following conclusions can be made:

- The Urban city type generates the highest revenue for the company.
- The Urban city type has the largest amount of drivers and rides.
- The Rural city type has the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

In addition, to the summary chart the below graphs were created to help visualize the data by city type.

In the below chart, the percentage of fares are broken down by city type.    The Urban city type represents the majority of the fares at 62.7%.

To continue the analysis, the data was broken down into percentage of rides.  The Urban city type represents the majority of the rides at 68.4%.

The last pie chart represents the number of drivers per city type.   The Urban city type represents the majority at 80.9% of drivers for PyBer.

The total fare data was then compiled by week and graphed to represent each of the different city types.   With this graph, trends can be identified by week and city type.    By reviewing the below graph, it is determined that all three city types show very similar trends throughout the weeks.    All three city types saw a spike during the third week of February.  In addition, all three city types saw an all time low during the third week of March.

# Summary: 
Based on the above infomration the following are recommended:

- When reviewing the weekly data, there are clear trends across all three city types.   It is recommended that further analysis be done as to the events that caused a rise in February and a fall in March across all segments.    Was there a major event in the area, weather, or a holiday that impacted the trends?   PyBer should use this analysis to ensure that drivers are available for weeks when there is more demand.

- The average fare per ride for Rural city type was $34.62.   This resulted in a fare that was over $10 more than the average fare for Urban, $24.53.   It is recommended that further research done as to why the fare is so much higher in the Rural city type.  This could provide an opportunity for revenue growth.

- To improve access for the Rural city types, it is recommended that more drivers be added.   This would provide more accessability to this city type that could increase the number of rides in an area that PyBer makes the highest fare rate. 

- The Urban city type is the most profitable with 62.7% of the fare revenue.    Unfortunately, their average fare is the lowest at $24.53.   Looking at the data, it is recommended that rates be increased for this city type.    This adjustment would also help to support the drivers, who are currently making the lowest per ride at only $16.57.
